# CHIP-8 Emulator

## Usage

`make run FILENAME=[filename]`

## Information

CHIP-8, according to Wikipedia, is an interpreted programming language, made in the 1970s to allow video games to be programmed for appropriate computers.

The architecture and opcodes of the CHIP-8 are simple enough for a beginner emulation project. This is my attempt at programming one of these emulators.
